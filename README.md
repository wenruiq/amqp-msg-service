## Disclaimer
This is a school project done by a team of 5 students, the ***APIs have been taken down*** so there isn't a live demo available

The original git repository for this project is set to private by the school so this is just a clone

Credit goes to the entire team I was mainly in charge of building the front end of the app

It is the source of inspiration for my personal project - [Chatty](https://github.com/wenruiq/chatty-wa)



## About the project
In this project we built the backend of a messaging app by adopting the micro-service architecture

AMQP is used to pass messages in the back end while Socket.IO is used to make instant messaging possible

The project requires the database to be local and we mostly made use of SQL Alchemy together we Flask to build the back end
### Built With
* [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
* [SQL Alchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
